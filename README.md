# INR-Tracker

For individuals on blood thinners, particularly the blood thinner Warfarin, the amount of time it takes for their blood to clot is a life or death question which can be on the individuals mind daily. Blood which does not clot fast enough can increase the risk of a severe bleeding event whereas blood which clots too quickly can increase the risk of stroke in patients at risk. According to a study released in the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology, Warfarin is prescribed to “at least 1% of the whole population and 8% of those aged over 80 years” (Pirmohamed 2006). However, even with this widespread prescription, problems resulting from Warfarin is a large cause of hospital admission as individuals are out of their prescribed range over 50% of the time. These out of range events are less often the result of individuals not taking their medicine as directed, but rather from the fact that Warfarin is a very ‘sensitive’ drug which interacts with many factors inside the body.  These can include vitamin K levels, blood alcohol levels, body weight changes, and other factors that influence blood coagulation. 

However bad these results seem, included with the study were findings of a direct correlation between closer monitoring of INR levels and reducing the number of ER visits for those on Warfarin. Essentially, the closer an individual tracks themselves, the more likely they are to stay in the safe range. Home measuring kits, while an excellent tool for measuring INR levels at a particular point in time, only show a single factor which can affect coagulation. Our proposal is creation of a tool which allows individuals to not only track their INR readings, compared to the range set by their healthcare provider, but also allows these individuals to track their food intake. Tracking food is critical since vitamin K can often have a delayed effect on INR levels up to as much as 24 hours after a reading. 

By providing individuals with a more comprehensive tracker, following multiple blood clotting factors which could eventually be used to correlate changes in the INR level, we aim to help individuals stay within their safe range and lead a longer life with less worry and risk.

 # System Specifications

The project will build on modern web application technologies to allow a high level of portability between different operating systems and device types. To help enhance modularity focus will be placed in ascribing to the Model View Controller (MVC) pattern with React.js utilized on the interactive front end, PHP on the backend for data manipulation and page generation, and MySQL as the backend database. This stack will also make use of the Laravel 5.2 PHP Framework for backend development and unit testing. The entire stack will be built on a code anywhere cloud container (Ubuntu 14.04 OS) for ease of deployment and portability.
